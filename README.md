The function of "Algorithm1" and "Algorithm2" are described in the paper "Computational field-resolved coherent chemical imaging".

The file "data.mat" is a set of three-dimensional data, with the sample being BSA powder immersed in pentadecane liquid. The three dimensions correspond to different spatial points x,y and different masks on the DMD. The variable "refsave" save the local PDA measurement results of the pump beam. The variable "imsave" save the CARS signal measured by the PMT. The variable "random_mask" contains the mask loaded onto the DMD.  "data.mat" is the input for both "Algorithm1" and "Algorithm2".

"BSA_spectrum.pth","pend_spectrum.pth" and "NR_spectrum.pth" are the input of "Algorithm2".
